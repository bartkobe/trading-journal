## Notes

### Tech Stack Recommendations

**Frontend Framework**: Next.js 14+ with App Router and TypeScript

- Modern React framework with excellent developer experience
- Built-in API routes for backend
- Server-side rendering and static generation support
- TypeScript for type safety

**Database**: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM

- Robust relational database perfect for structured trade data
- Prisma provides type-safe database access and easy migrations
- Can be hosted on Supabase, Railway, Neon, or other cloud providers

**Authentication**: JWT with httpOnly cookies

- Simple email/password authentication using bcryptjs for hashing
- JSON Web Tokens for stateless session management
- Secure cookie storage

**Cloud Storage**: Cloudinary or AWS S3

- Cloudinary: Easier setup, automatic image optimization, generous free tier
- AWS S3: More control, lower cost at scale

**Styling**: Tailwind CSS

- Utility-first CSS framework
- Easy to implement light/dark themes
- Fast development with minimal custom CSS

**Charts**: Recharts or Chart.js

- Recharts: React-first, composable, works well with Next.js
- Chart.js: Powerful, well-documented, wide variety of chart types

**Form Handling**: React Hook Form with Zod validation

- Performant form library with minimal re-renders
- Zod for runtime type validation

**Rich Text Editor**: Tiptap or Quill

- Tiptap: Modern, extensible, headless editor
- Quill: Mature, feature-rich, easy to integrate

### Development Approach

1. **Start with Infrastructure**: Database schema and authentication are foundational
2. **Build Core Features First**: Trade CRUD is the heart of the application
3. **Add Analytics Layer**: Once trades are working, implement calculations and visualizations
4. **Polish UI/UX**: Theme, navigation, and responsive design throughout
5. **Test Thoroughly**: Focus on calculation accuracy and data integrity
6. **Deploy Early**: Get to production quickly, iterate based on real usage

### Key Considerations

- **Single User**: Simplified authentication and data model (no multi-tenancy)
- **Multi-Currency**: Store currency per trade, display in original currency (no conversion needed)
- **One Entry/Exit**: Simpler data model, no position scaling
- **Manual Fees**: User enters total commission amount, no auto-calculation
- **Desktop First**: Optimize for minimum 1280px width
- **No Notifications**: Purely on-demand, no email/push features
- **CSV Export Only**: Single export format for initial version

### Testing Commands

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm test -- --watch

# Run tests with coverage
npm test -- --coverage

# Run specific test file
npm test -- __tests__/lib/analytics.test.ts

# Run Prisma migrations
npx prisma migrate dev

# Generate Prisma client
npx prisma generate

# Open Prisma Studio (database GUI)
npx prisma studio
```

### Estimated Timeline

- **Phase 1 (Setup & Auth)**: 2-3 days
- **Phase 2 (Trade CRUD)**: 4-5 days
- **Phase 3 (Analytics)**: 3-4 days
- **Phase 4 (UI/UX)**: 2-3 days
- **Phase 5 (Features)**: 2-3 days
- **Phase 6 (Testing)**: 2-3 days
- **Phase 7 (Deployment)**: 1-2 days

**Total Estimated Time**: 16-23 days for a junior developer working full-time

### Success Criteria

The implementation will be complete when:

- ✅ All 29 functional requirements from PRD are implemented
